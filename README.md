## Overview

  This is my attempt on the Sunnyside Agency Landing Page Challenge.
  After being unable to practice HTML & CSS for about 2 months I decided to jump into a Junior project and really push myself to learn Sass and everything else just with the help of Google and some Youtube.
  I'm really glad that I could recreate the design but it lacks responsiveness, Eduardo Bou√ßas's mixins really helped but I need to practice and study media queries much more.
  
  I would highly apreciate suggestions, help and tips on what I could've done better or how I can improve this challenge.
  Will work on this project until it is 100% done.

  Thank you for having a look at my attempt!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Sass


### What I learned

Learned how to make a basic hamburguer menu with JS and definetely learned more about Sass which i'm starting to really really like. 


### Continued development

This project is far from complete, I managed to make it look the same as the design files but it is not 100% complete. My goal is to make 100% responsive.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://eduardoboucas.github.io/include-media/) - Even though I need to practice media queries and mixins a lot more, this helped me explore and get the result I wanted.
- [Example resource 2](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - Used this codepen to get the correct filter property and color.
